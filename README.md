# React Switch

This is an experiment to see if I could write a `switch` statement in a React-y declarative syntax with higher-order components. It's a toy project, deliberately not published on npm, please don't use this in production.

## Example

```
<Switch expression="foo">
  <Case clause="foo>I render!</Case>
<Switch>
```

Check out the [tests](src/components/Switch/Switch.test.tsx) for the `Switch` component for more examples.
